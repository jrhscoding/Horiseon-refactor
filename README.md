# Horiseon-refactor
Module 1 challenge/homework

This weeks challenge/homework was on cleaning up HTML and CSS elements to provide a cleaner viewing experience for other developers
that will view the webpage anytime in the future.

Properly commenting your html and css as well as organizing your ccs styles in a chronological manner improves the viewability and 
accessability for any future changes that may need to be made.

In addition to general cleanup, this was also centered around accessibility for the viewer. Changing multiple div tags to be more
descriptive as to what content the user is viewing. 

The criteria was as follows:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
